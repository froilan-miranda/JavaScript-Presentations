					<h3>History of Javascript</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Do not confuse JavaScript with Java</li>
						<li>JavaScript was created in 10 days in May 1995 by Brendan Eich</li>
						<li>Brendan Eich at the time worked at Netscape and now of Mozilla</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

					<h3>History of Javascript</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The original name was Mocha, chosen from the founder of Netscape</li>
						<li>September of 1995 the name was changed to LiveScript</li>
						<li>December of the same year, it received a trademark license from Sun to use JavaScript</li>
						<li>It was somewhat of a marketing move, because of the popularity of Java at the time</li>
						<li>Do not confuse JavaScript with Java</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section><!------------------------------------slide---------------------------------------------->
					<h3>History of Javascript</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>1996 - 1997 JavaScript was taken to ECMA to carve out a standard specification</li>
						<li>European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA)</li>
						<li>This would allow other browser vendors to implement based on the work done at Netscape</li>
						<li>ECMAScript is the name of the official standard with JavaScript being the most well known implementation</li>
						<li>ActionScript 3 is another well-known implementation of ECMAScript</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section><!------------------------------------slide---------------------------------------------->
					<h3>History of Javascript</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The standards process continued in cycles</li>
						<li>1998 - ECMAScript 2</li>
						<li>1999 - ECMAScript 3 (baseline of modern JavaScript)</li>
						<li>2000 - The "JS2" or "original ES4" work led by Waldemar Horwat (then of Netscape, now at Google) started</li>
						<li>At first, Microsoft seemed to participate and even implemented some of the proposals in their JScript.net language.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section><!------------------------------------slide---------------------------------------------->
					<h3>History of Javascript</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>It became clear though that Microsoft had no intention of cooperating or implementing proper JS in IE</li>
						<li>Even though they had no competing proposal and they had a partial (and diverged at this point) implementation on the .NET server side.</li>
						<li>By 2003 the JS2/original-ES4 work was mothballed.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section><!------------------------------------slide---------------------------------------------->
					<h3>History of Javascript</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The next major event was in 2005, with two major happenings in JavaScript’s history</li>
						<li>First, Brendan Eich and Mozilla rejoined Ecma as a not-for-profit member and work started on E4X, ECMA-357, which came from ex-Microsoft employees at BEA (originally acquired as Crossgain).</li>
						<li>This led to working jointly with Macromedia, who were implementing E4X in ActionScript 3(ActionScript 3 was a fork of Waldemar's JS2/original-ES4 work).</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section><!------------------------------------slide---------------------------------------------->
					<h3>History of Javascript</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>So, along with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe), work restarted on ECMAScript 4 with the goal of standardizing what was in AS3 and implementing it in SpiderMonkey.</li>
						<li>To this end, Adobe released the "AVM2", code named Tamarin, as an open source project. But Tamarin and AS3 were too different from web JavaScript to converge, as was realized by the parties in 2007 and 2008.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section><!------------------------------------slide---------------------------------------------->
					<h3>History of Javascript</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Alas, there was still turmoil between the various players; Doug Crockford — then at Yahoo! — joined forces with Microsoft in 2007 to oppose ECMAScript 4, which led to the ECMAScript 3.1 effort.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>


				<section><!------------------------------------slide---------------------------------------------->
					<section>While all of this was happening the open source and developer communities set to work to revolutionize what could be done with JavaScript.</section>

					<section>This community effort was sparked in 2005 when Jesse James Garrett released a white paper in which he coined the term Ajax, and described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, used to create web applications where data can be loaded in the background, avoiding the need for full page reloads and resulting in more dynamic applications.</section>

					<section>This resulted in a renaissance period of JavaScript usage spearheaded by open source libraries and the communities that formed around them, with libraries such as Prototype, jQuery, Dojo and Mootools and others being released.</section>
				</section>

				<section><!------------------------------------slide---------------------------------------------->
					<h3>History of Javascript</h3>
					<section>In July of 2008 the disparate parties on either side came together in Oslo.</section>
					<section>This led to the eventual agreement in early 2009 to rename ECMAScript 3.1 to ECMAScript 5 and drive the language forward using an agenda that is known as Harmony.</section>
				</section>

				<section><!------------------------------------slide---------------------------------------------->
					<h3>History of Javascript</h3>
					<section>All of this then brings us to today, with JavaScript entering a completely new and exciting cycle of evolution, innovation and standardisation, with new developments such as the Nodejs platform, allowing us to use JavaScript on the server-side, and HTML5 APIs to control user media, open up web sockets for always-on communication, get data on geographical location and device features such as accelerometer, and more.</section>
